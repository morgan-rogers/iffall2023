        <p>Instructions: 
            <br>
            STEP ONE: Start by drying your pumpkin. This may seem weird but it is the only way these cookies will bake properly and not turn out cakey! Spread your pumpkin on a plate and place a paper towel over the top. Lightly press to absorb the liquid. Repeat the step at least four more times. (It needs to reduce down to ¼ cup from ½ cup). Set aside.
            <br>
            STEP TWO: In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
            <br>
            STEP THREE: In a large bowl cream the softened butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer.
            <br>
            STEP FOUR: Add in the egg yolks and vanilla and mix for one minute until pale and fluffy.
            <br>
            STEP FIVE: Add in the pumpkin and mix on medium-low speed to combine.
            <br>
            STEP SIX: Add in the dry ingredients and mix on low speed just until combined.
            <br>
            STEP SEVEN: Scoop the dough into 18 balls and roll them in the spiced sugar. Scoop the dough with a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop, and roll them into balls. Then roll the dough balls in the spiced sugar.(If the dough is too "sticky" chill it in the fridge for 10 minutes, then proceed.)
            <br>
            STEP EIGHT: Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes. (12 minutes for really chewy centers, 14 minutes for a slightly crispier cookie). When the cookies are done baking the centers will be puffy. As they cool the centers will fall and the cookie will get "wrinkly".
            <br>
            STEP NINE:
            Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to finish cooling. They are best enjoyed when they have cooled for at least 15 minutes!

        <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
        <p>
             <a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a40272839/apple-cookie-recipe/">Website 1:</a> What I like about this recipe website, especially in comparison to other recipe websites, is that it uses hierarchy well. For example, there are visual elements used to draw attention or highlight specfic details. The ingredients are listed to the left side, so the user doesn't have to spend as much time scrolling. The use of a light blue box distinguishes important details like the calories.
        </p>
        <p>
             <a href="https://damndelicious.net/">Website 2:</a> This site has a great layout that emphasizes recipes through images. They incorporate icons which I can imagine being used in my own recipe page to make the information more digestible. The recipe part of the article is also very distinct from the description. I've noticed that on many recipe pages, the description and recipe tend to blend into one, and I will end up completely missing the recipe while scrolling. This is a great way to break down the information visually. 
        </p>
        <p>
             <a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8073602/beet-avocado-wrap/">Website 3:</a> These recipe pages also make user of visual elements like boxes to make the information easy to understand. I also notice that they use large headings to separate information, which a lot of recipe pages don't do.
        </p>

        <h2>Website Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
             <a href="https://root-food.com/">Website 1:</a> Although this website is very elaborate in its design, what I like about it is how it devided the experience into distinct sections as the user scrolls. I like this concept for allowing the user to understand where they are in the recipe process. Large text is used to divide the sections with supplementary images that aren't too distracting.
        </p>
        <p>
             <a href="https://fabbricagroup.fr/cosa-si-mangia/">Website 2:</a> I really enjoy the way this page is divided into left and right. The user does not have to go through a tiring scroll journey, which is common on recipe pages, because of the way the images and text move. The middle section breaks up the other two for hierarchy and I like the use of the illustration in combination with images.
        </p>
        <p>
             <a href="https://guiadaproteina.natureza-portugal.org/">Website 3:</a> I like the idea of dividing up my website into colored sections, and icorporating images that are free-floating like in this page. It also might be interesting to have an interactive recipe, although this might get in the way of the true goal!
