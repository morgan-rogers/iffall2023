                <h1>Walk in the Park</h1>
                <h2>Beach House</h2>
                <p id="first-description">This song is about losing someone that you were in love with and how you move on. The walk in the park represents a meaningless activity because you might feel empty and without purpose after the loss. The rest of the song is descriptions of whats missing, which is what you would notice when doing an effortless activity like walking in the park.</p>

                <p>The hand that you sometimes hold doesn't do anything</p>
